I'll create a traditional JavaScript Node.js chatbot API for you.

Now let me create a README file with usage instructions and example requests:

Now let me create a simple HTML client for testing the API:

Now let me move these files to the output directory:

I've created a complete AI-powered chatbot API for you using traditional JavaScript syntax! Here's what I've built:

## Files Created:

1. **chatbot-api.js** - The main Node.js server with:
   - Traditional JavaScript (no arrow functions, only `var` declarations)
   - RESTful API endpoints for chat, history, and more
   - In-memory conversation storage
   - Pattern-based AI responses
   - Runs on localhost:3000

2. **README.md** - Complete documentation with:
   - Setup instructions
   - API endpoint details
   - cURL testing examples
   - Configuration options

3. **client.html** - A beautiful web interface to test your chatbot directly in the browser

## To Get Started:

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node chatbot-api.js
   ```

2. Test with the web client by opening `client.html` in your browser, or use cURL:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Hello!"}'
   ```

The API uses only core Node.js modules (http, url) - no external dependencies needed! The chatbot can respond to greetings, time/date queries, jokes, and general conversation using pattern matching.
